# FPGA
This repository contains FPGA design projects on the Terasic DE10-Lite board (Intel MAX 10 FPGA) using Quartus Prime Lite. It includes VHDL/Verilog codes for digital circuits, verification and testbenches viewed on GTKWave, QSF pin assignments, RTL simulations, and designs with IP cores, FSMs, communication protocols, DSP, and microcontrollers.
